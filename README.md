# E-Commerce API

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure db connection string is set to a valid value in `appsettings.Development.json` (server will need to be changed if SQL Server Express LocalDB is not installed)
2. Build and run app (db will be created with seed data automatically using the connection set in `appsettings.Development.json`)

Endpoints can be tested using Postman by importing the requests in `LRQA Dev Challenge.postman_collection.json`
